/**
 * The {@code logic} package contains the core business logic and utility functions
 * for user interaction, clarification handling, and input recognition used throughout the application.
 * <p>
 * This package acts as the central point for implementing:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Clarification management between users</li>
 *   <li>Email, username, and password recognition and validation</li>
 *   <li>User interface status tracking</li>
 *   <li>Search operations across questions and answers</li>
 *   <li>Menu logic for user QA interaction</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Class Summary:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ClarificationsManager} – Manages creation, retrieval, and storage of user clarifications.</li>
 *   <li>{@link EmailRecognizer} – Provides logic to identify or validate email addresses in text input.</li>
 *   <li>{@link PasswordRecognizer} – Validates passwords and may contain logic for strength checks or formatting.</li>
 *   <li>{@link Result} – A generic wrapper for operation results, typically includes success flags and messages.</li>
 *   <li>{@link SearchFunction} – Implements search algorithms for filtering questions, answers, or users.</li>
 *   <li>{@link StatusData} – Maintains global application state such as current user, selected question, or database helper instance.</li>
 *   <li>{@link UserNameRecognizer} – Extracts or verifies usernames from text, likely used during login or message parsing.</li>
 *   <li>{@link UserQAMenu} – Controls the QA-related user interface menu and user interactions.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This package is designed to separate business logic from UI and data models, ensuring modularity and reusability.
